**distribution**
(Anything but nixos) e.g. Arch Linux

**derivatives**
e.g. Manjaro, Garuda, Endevour OS...

**package manager along with the install command to golang, docker and sqlite3**
e.g. pacman -Sy go docker sqlite3

**additional context**
e.g. The package manager I have described can't install multiple packages at once, meaning it has to be multiple lines...

**I'm sure that**
- [ ] It's obviously anywhere (in the wiki)
If your not sure, your issue **will** be closed.
